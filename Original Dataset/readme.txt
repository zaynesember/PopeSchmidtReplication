README file for replication of “Father Founders: Did child gender affect voting at the Constitutional Convention” by Jeremy C. Pope and Soren J. Schmidt.“father founders code-final replication” – This is a .do STATA file created to produce all of the tables and figures in the paper and the appendix.  It has notes and is meant to be self-explanatory.  “founding fathers dataset-corrections-attendance-replication” – This is a STATA file (probably converted to ASCII by the repository) with all of the data necessary to replicate the findings as well as some additional data from the sources from which this was created.  The file is a combination of our own research into gender of children (see the early variables with source notes in the file), the original dataset from McGuire on the 16 votes discussed in the paper, and some additional data on attendance and the appendix material created from Heckelman and Dougherty’s work as described in the paper.  The original McGuire dataset he provided to us is shared here "Philadelphia Data with Descriptions_Shared Data.tab".

"Codebook-pope-schmidt-2020" - This is a .pdf file with all of the variables in the replication dataset, with simple descriptions and codes for categorical variables.

"Philadelphia Data with Descriptions_Shared Data.tab" - This is an Excel file with the original data shared with us from Robert McGuire.  Future replicators may, of course, request the data directly from Prof. McGuire (mcguire@uakron.edu).  This data is an original copy of the data he shared with us several years ago that was used in his work -- A More Perfect Union -- as described in the text and the appendix, which he confirms is correct. Additional Notes: Notes in the .do file are meant to be self-explanatory, but persons with questions may contact Jeremy C. Pope (jpope@byu.edu) or Soren J. Schmidt (sorenjschmidt@gmail.com).   Software statement: All of these files were originally created in version STATA 16.0 and were uploaded in that format.  Note, that the authors can be contacted for any questions about that: jpope@byu.edu and sorenjschmidt@gmail.com.
